# Golf Trail

This project focuses on predicting the final golf ball location after the ball is hit by the golfer with only one camera using Machine Learning Algorithms and Open CV.

## Getting Strated 

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

1) To install the dependencies, you need to ``install`` the following:

- python 3
- openCV-python
- numpy
- mathplotlib
- scipy
- csv

2) Capture the side view of the shot.

3) Run ``final_show.py`` to get real time prediction.

5) Mark the position of ball to create a contour over it.

6) Press Q to Continue.

7) This would give your final predictible position of the shot.

## Factors Considered

- Initial Speed
- Angle of projection
- Angle from Ground
- Spin of the ball
- Wind speed
- Air drag
- Magnus Effect
- Coefficient of friction of ground
- Ball Weight
